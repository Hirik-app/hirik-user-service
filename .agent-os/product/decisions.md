## 2025-07-30: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Hirik Platform is a comprehensive HR/recruitment platform targeting job seekers, recruiters, and companies with a focus on real-time communication, advanced search, and global edge performance through serverless architecture.

### Context

The recruitment industry suffers from fragmented experiences, poor global performance, and limited real-time communication. Traditional platforms use centralized architectures that can't provide consistent global performance or real-time features at scale.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Monolithic Architecture**
   - Pros: Simpler deployment, easier data consistency, familiar patterns
   - Cons: Poor global performance, scaling limitations, single points of failure

2. **Microservices on Traditional Cloud**
   - Pros: Service isolation, independent scaling, technology diversity
   - Cons: Higher latency, complex networking, regional performance variations

### Rationale

Selected serverless edge-first architecture to provide superior global performance, natural service isolation, and built-in scalability while reducing operational overhead.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Sub-100ms global response times through edge computing
- Natural service boundaries with Cloudflare Workers
- Automatic scaling without infrastructure management
- Cost-effective pay-per-use pricing model

**Negative:**
- Vendor lock-in to Cloudflare ecosystem
- Learning curve for edge computing patterns
- Cold start considerations for infrequent endpoints

## 2025-07-30: Dual Database Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Backend Engineers

### Decision

Implement dual database strategy using Cloudflare D1 for user-specific edge data and PostgreSQL for core business logic and cross-service data consistency.

### Context

Need to balance edge performance for user-specific operations with data consistency requirements for business-critical operations. Single database approach would compromise either performance or consistency.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **PostgreSQL Only**
   - Pros: ACID compliance, mature ecosystem, complex queries
   - Cons: Higher latency from edge, no edge caching benefits

2. **D1 Only**
   - Pros: Edge performance, tight Cloudflare integration
   - Cons: SQLite limitations, 10GB database size limit, limited cross-database queries

### Rationale

Dual database approach maximizes edge performance for user operations while maintaining data integrity for business logic through logical references between databases.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast user profile access through edge caching
- Consistent business data through PostgreSQL ACID properties
- Optimal performance for both user and business operations

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in data modeling
- No foreign key constraints across databases
- Eventual consistency considerations between edge and core data

## 2025-07-30: Modular Service Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Structure each Cloudflare Worker service using modular architecture with separate controller, routes, and types files organized by business domain (auth, user, profile modules).

### Context

Need clean separation of concerns within individual services while maintaining simplicity and avoiding over-engineering in serverless environment.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single File per Service**
   - Pros: Simple deployment, fewer files
   - Cons: Poor maintainability, mixed concerns, difficult testing

2. **Full MVC Framework**
   - Pros: Familiar patterns, clear separation
   - Cons: Overhead in serverless, unnecessary complexity for small services

### Rationale

Modular approach provides clear separation of concerns without framework overhead, making services maintainable while keeping them lightweight for edge deployment.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear business domain boundaries
- Easy to test individual modules
- Maintainable codebase with logical organization
- Consistent patterns across all services

**Negative:**
- More files to manage per service
- Need to maintain consistent module patterns
- Potential for module coupling if not carefully designed

## 2025-07-30: JWT-Based Authentication

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Security Lead, Backend Engineers

### Decision

Implement JWT-based authentication with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) and long-lived refresh tokens (7 days) using Hono JWT middleware for route protection.

### Context

Need secure, scalable authentication that works efficiently in serverless edge environment without session storage requirements.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Session-Based Authentication**
   - Pros: Server-side session control, easier revocation
   - Cons: Requires session storage, poor edge performance, scaling challenges

2. **API Key Authentication**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, no expiration handling
   - Cons: No user context, difficult key rotation, security risks

### Rationale

JWT provides stateless authentication perfect for edge computing while offering good security through short access token lifespans and refresh token rotation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- No server-side session storage required
- Excellent edge performance with stateless validation
- Built-in token expiration and refresh mechanism
- User context embedded in tokens

**Negative:**
- Token revocation complexity
- Potential token size concerns with user data
- Client-side token storage security considerations
